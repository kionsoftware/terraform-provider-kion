# kion_aws_account (Resource)

Creates or imports an AWS Account and adds it to a Kion project or the Kion account cache.

If `account_number` is provided, an existing account will be imported into Kion, otherwise a new AWS account will be created.  If `project_id` is provided the account will be added to the corresponding project, otherwise the account will be added to the account cache.

Once added, an account can be moved between projects or in and out of the account cache by changing the `project_id`.  When moving accounts between projects, use `move_project_settings` to control how financials will be treated between the old and new project.

When importing an existing Kion account into terraform state (different from using terraform to import an existing AWS account into Kion), you must use the `account_id=` or `account_cache_id=` ID prefix to indicate whether the ID is an account ID or a cached account ID.

For example:

    terraform import kion_aws_account.test-account account_id=123
    terraform import kion_aws_account.test-cached-account account_cache_id=321

**NOTE:** This resource requires Kion v3.8.4 or greater.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a new AWS account and place it in the account cache
resource "kion_aws_account" "test2" {
  name                    = "Terraform Created AWS Account - 2"
  payer_id                = 1
  commercial_account_name = "Test Account"
  create_govcloud         = false

  aws_organizational_unit {
    name        = "test name"
    org_unit_id = "123456"
  }
}

# Output the ID of the resource created.
output "kion_account_id" {
  value = kion_aws_account.test2.id
}
```
