# kion_billing_source_aws_govcloud (Resource)

Creates and manages an AWS GovCloud billing source.

AWS GovCloud billing sources are attached to commercial AWS billing sources and enable GovCloud account management capabilities. The parent commercial billing source must exist before creating the GovCloud billing source.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create an AWS GovCloud billing source attached to a commercial billing source
resource "kion_billing_source_aws_govcloud" "example" {
  commercial_billing_source_id = 123  # ID of the commercial AWS billing source
  name                         = "GovCloud Billing Account"
  aws_account_number           = "123456789012"
  account_creation_enabled     = true
}

# Example with data source for commercial billing source
data "kion_funding_source" "commercial" {
  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["Commercial AWS Billing Source"]
  }
}

resource "kion_billing_source_aws_govcloud" "example_with_data" {
  commercial_billing_source_id = data.kion_funding_source.commercial.list[0].id
  name                         = "GovCloud Billing Account"
  aws_account_number           = "123456789012"
  account_creation_enabled     = false
}
