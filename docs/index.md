# Kion Provider

The Kion provider allows you to interact with an installation of Kion.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "kion" {
  # If these are commented out, they will be loaded from
  # environment variables.
  # url = "https://kion.example.com"
  # apikey = "key here"
}

# Create an IAM policy.
resource "kion_aws_iam_policy" "p1" {
  name         = "sample-resource"
  description  = "Provides AdministratorAccess to all AWS Services"
  aws_iam_path = ""
  owner_users { id = 1 }
  owner_user_groups { id = 1 }
  policy = <<EOF
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "*",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}

}

# Output the ID of the resource created.
output "policy_id" {
  value = kion_aws_iam_policy.p1.id
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- **apikey** (String, Sensitive) The API key generated from Kion. Example: app_1_XXXXXXXXXXXX.
- **url** (String) The URL of a Kion installation. Example: https://kion.example.com.

### Optional

- **skipsslvalidation** (Boolean) If true, will skip SSL validation.

### Environment Variables

If you want to configure the provider via environment variables, you can use these below.

```bash
export KION_APIKEY="app_1_XXXXXXXXXXXX"
export KION_URL="https://kion.example.com"
export KION_SKIPSSLVALIDATION="false"
```

### Importing Resource State

This provider does support [importing state for resources](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/import/index.html). You will need to create the Terraform files and then you can run commands like this to generate the `terraform.tfstate` so you don't have to delete all your resources and then recreate them to work with Terraform:

```bash
# Initialize the project.
terraform init

# Import the resource from your environment - this assumes you have a module called
# 'aws-cloudformation-template' and you are importing into a resource you defined as 'AuditLogging'.
# The '20' at the end is the ID of the resource in Kion.
terraform import module.aws-cloudformation-template.kion_aws_cloudformation_template.AuditLogging 20

# Verify the state is correct - there shouldn't be any changes listed if you defined
# the resources correctly.
terraform plan
```
