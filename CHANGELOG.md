# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.3.15] - 2024-05-17

- No changes.  This change was needed to get the Terraform Registry back in sync with Github.

## [0.3.14] - 2024-05-15

- Fixed an issue where the provider would attempt to update project labels even when labels were not defined in the HCL. The provider now checks if labels are explicitly set and non-empty before making update requests, preventing unnecessary API calls and avoiding the `405 Method Not Allowed error` from any Kion version before v3.7.7.
- Added examples into example directory that previously only were in the `README.md` file.  This allows each resources to have more example information directly in the resource docs.

## [0.3.13] - 2024-04-09

- Changed `aws_cloudformation_templates` and `azure_arm_template_definitions` from `TypeSet` to `TypeList` in the Terraform provider schema to preserve the order of templates as specified in Terraform configurations.
- Updated the `resourceCloudRuleCreate` function to build lists of template IDs directly from the Terraform state, ensuring order preservation during cloud rule creation.
- Modified the `resourceCloudRuleRead` function to correctly parse and set ordered template lists in the Terraform state, maintaining consistency with the API.
- Bump Go Version to 1.22

## [0.3.12] - 2024-03-29

- Introduced several enhancements and refactoring changes to the Makefile and the Terraform provider. The key changes include adding a development build option, introducing a sync mechanism for AWS account creation, allowing more than one `kion_aws_account` to be created at once.

## [0.3.11] - 2024-03-20

- Introduced retry logic in the AWS account creation process within the Terraform Provider. This improvement is designed to handle scenarios where the account creation is temporarily hindered by ongoing AWS service operations. The logic includes a default retry count of three attempts with a delay of 30 seconds between each attempt, enhancing the robustness of the account creation process in fluctuating AWS service conditions.

## [0.3.10] - 2024-02-29

- Added support for `azure_role_definitions` in OU Cloud Access Roles. This enhancement includes the ability to define and manage Azure role definitions directly within Terraform.

## [0.3.9] - 2024-02-15

- Fixed an issue where users were unable to create Kion Azure Policy resources due to certain attributes (`name`, `description`, `policy`, `parameters`) being set to "Read-Only" in the Terraform Kion Provider. This fix involves changing the `Computed: true` parameter for these attributes to either `Required` or `Optional`, based on the API documentation for azure-policy. This change allows for the proper creation and management of Azure Policy resources within Terraform.

## [0.3.8] - 2024-01-03

- Fixed an issue that prevented importing existing Kion accounts into the terraform state.  When importing existing accounts, the user should specify the account ID using an `account_id=` or `account_cache_id=` prefix to tell the terraform provider whether the provided ID is an account ID or a cached account ID.  See the README for more information.

## [0.3.7] - 2023-12-21
